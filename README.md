Overview
===
  New York City has been the largest city in the United States since 1790. The Statue of Liberty welcomed millions of immigrants who came to America by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. New York City is a symbol of America and its ideals of freedom and peace. Because it is the largest city in the United States, security has been one of the major problems plaguing these large cities. In our group's project we selected the NYPD's police reports of shootings from 2006-2019, which include data related to the incidents such as : date, time, borough，sex, age, ethnicity, etc. of victims and perpetrators as well as the latitude and longitude of the case。
  
What is the benefit of knowing this for us？
===
  For those of us who live in New York City, it is important that we have some understanding of the security situation in the boroughs and even streets where we live. Using our data analysis to understand how the security situation in New York City has been trending over the last decade or so and the level of danger at various times can help us better understand the safety of our own living environment.

Over the past decade or so, we have been able to see the number of shootings decline each year, and by the year ending 2019 the number of shootings in our cities was at the lowest level in the data
